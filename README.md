### Idea about project

I did this application with create-react-app template with typescript , I did use tailwind as design library for my components
the entry point of the app is App.tsx file It gone show the routes (the default route is "/")
folders are like so :

- components : where i did put app components
- layout : where i did define the layout for the app
- models : some typescript models
- routes : where i did define react routes with react router
- services : where i did put async method to call server
- utils : some utils functions
